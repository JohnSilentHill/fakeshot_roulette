# General Info

This is a Python text-based recreation of Buckshot Roulette by Mike Klubnika. <br/>
It should contain the .py file and a .json save file.

> All save data is 0 by default but fully modifiable by editing the `savegame.json` file (use Notepad++ or VS Code if unsure).

This project is highly WIP and you can view the roadmap below to get a general idea as to the progress so far. <br/>
Feel free to fork and create pull requests as you please. If you are more experienced with Python, please do take a look. <br/>
