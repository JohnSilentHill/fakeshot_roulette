# General Info

This is a Python text-based recreation of Buckshot Roulette by Mike Klubnika. <br/>

Currently, there are *most* of the items from the original game bar a few multiplayer-specific ones that probably won't be added since this is offline only. 

You can use the official [wiki](https://buckshot-roulette.fandom.com/wiki/Buckshot_Roulette_Wik) or the 'info' command in-game for help.

### Boring things

- For debug, you can use the `debug` command when it is **your turn** after starting the game. This isn't accessible on the main menu because it displays information regarding the current gamestate. I'm not sure it would have any use elsewhere.
- This project is highly WIP and you can view the roadmap below to get a general idea as to the progress so far. <br/>
Feel free to fork and create pull requests as you please. If you are more experienced with Python, please do take a look. <br/>
- Your save is blank by default, with no wins or money. You can simply play the game or edit your save manually to fix this glaring issue.

> Open the `savegame.json` file under the parent directory in any text exitor of your choice. The values are pretty self-explanatory.
