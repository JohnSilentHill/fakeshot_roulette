# General Info

This is a Python text-based recreation of Buckshot Roulette by Mike Klubnika. <br/>
It should contain the .py file and two .json save files.

> IMPORTANT: There are currently 2 save files within each release. One is a fresh save, and the other starts with 10,000 money and 100 wins. <br/>
> Choose 1 file ONLY, you can always edit it to your liking later and the modified one is just for debugging convenience.

 <br/>

This project is highly WIP and you can view the roadmap below to get a general idea as to the progress so far. <br/>
Feel free to fork and create pull requests as you please. If you are more experienced with Python, please do take a look.
